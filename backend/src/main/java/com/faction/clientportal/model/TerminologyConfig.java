/**
 * What this installation calls the things it holds.
 *
 * <p>"Organization" is the product's word, not necessarily the customer's. A consultancy's
 * organizations are their client companies; an enterprise security team's might be value streams,
 * business units, or portfolios. Making people translate the product's vocabulary into their own
 * every time they read a screen is a small tax paid constantly.
 *
 * <p>Singular and plural are both stored rather than deriving one from the other. Appending "s"
 * is right often enough to be tempting and wrong often enough to look careless — "Value Stream"
 * pluralises cleanly, "Entity" and "Business" do not.
 *
 * <p>Severity labels live here too, for the same reason: a team that runs on "P1"–"P4" or
 * "Sev-1"–"Sev-5" reads "Critical" as a translation step. Only the label moves — the
 * {@link VulnerabilitySeverity} constants, and therefore every stored row, every SLA rule, every
 * report token and both export formats, keep saying CRITICAL. There is deliberately no way to add
 * or remove a level: the enum is closed and the ranking, the SLA config and the SARIF/CycloneDX
 * mappings are all written against exactly these five.
